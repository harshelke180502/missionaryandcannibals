# missionaryandcannibals
  In the puzzle, we have:     
  Three missionaries and three cannibals on one side of the river.   
  A boat that can carry a maximum of two people (either two missionaries, two cannibals, or one of each).     
  The missionaries and cannibals cannot be outnumbered at any time on either side of the river, or the cannibals will eat the missionaries.
